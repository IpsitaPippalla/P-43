The title of my game is "Hardworking Natasha".

The goal of the game is that Natasha has to collect 500 coins that values 100 worth i.e. 100 dollars of each coin, to maintain the financial condition of her family.

Brief Story:-

There is a family who is suffering from a financial condition since two years. The couple has three sons and two daughters. The couple used to work hard in their farm to grow vegetables and sell them in the market to earn living. They were able to do this job without any strain and stress but after few years a plague of locusts in their field damaged their crops and only quarter of crops were saved. Since then their life was miserable and it became difficult for them to sustain their life. 

At present they are finding odd jobs so that they can earn a living for themselves and sustain their family and can start their business again. The two daughters Natasha and Kristie are also concerned about the hardships their family is exposed to and decided to do something for them while the boys were already working hard to maintain the financial condition but they were always in vain to earn the profits because the country where they are living, had no jobs left even for small people because of larger population in that country.

One day Natasha asked her father why they were suffering like this and how they can tackle this suffering. Then her father told her, every life is not perfect. In everyone's life, there would be a difficult time, and we have to tackle this time in order to get a peaceful and undisturbed life. The difficult time may come at any time, and we have to be ready to fight against it by working hard and earning money in order to maintain the livelihood and food for us. Without any hard work, we don't get anything, and we will not get a peaceful and happy life. After listening to her father, she decided to do something great for her family.
One day she heard the news about an ordinary person who became great and famous all over the world by doing a great and good business for people by selling fresh and organic fruits and vegetables. She decided to do a great business for the people just like him. Then she asked her trusted and distinct cousin who always loved and encouraged her and knew everything about the businesses, so she decided to ask him. He told her that setting up the business is not an easy task. It requires a lot of education, planning and information about its functions and facts. In fact it would take the time to set up the business. He could helped her to provide education and information about the business by teaching her free-cost. After listening to his words she was delighted and decided to sacrifice all the things to fulfill her dream and she hoped that one day she would help her parents to bring back their financial condition by working hard and spread her name all over the world and would became great business woman in the world. 

Through this story I want to make a game where Natasha is running in her journey like she is working hard and collecting coins and she has to finish her target by collecting 500 coins and each coin stands for 100 worth i.e. 100 dollars. 

Facts of the Game
Characters in game:-
1) Non - Playing characters: Obstacles would act as enemies as in every task of the life something should be there that create more difficulties in the task. So in this game the enemies are obstacles and moreover there is also a helping hand of the obstacles that is a danger ball that would create more difficulty in the game. It would reduce the score that means the danger ball would take some of the coins from the player.

Second non - playing character is a crystal ball that acts as a helping partner of a playing character. In everyone's life there should a companion or supporting character that support them in their difficulties times. In this game the crystal ball can be Natasha's cousin who would help and support her. 

2) Playing Character is the Natasha whose key is operated by the player. They have to press some keys to defend themselves from the obstacles and the danger ball. 

Idea of the Game
If the player touch one of the obstacles they would lose one lifeline. And if the player touches the danger ball then she has to give 20 coins to the danger ball. There are five lifelines and if the player lose all the five lifelines before reaching the target the game would be ended. But they can get a permanent lifeline by catching the crystal ball that would come at rare time and canâ€™t be lost by the player. The player is Natasha itself and they have to reach the target by collecting the 500 coins and defending themselves from the enemies.

Aim of the Game
The aim of the game is that without any hard work, one can't reach their goal and can't fulfill their dream. Through this game a player can learn that how we can tackle the given situation and move forward and correct their mistakes that they made in their journey. In this game, if a player loses one lifeline, that would be counted as their mistake, and they can correct that mistake by taking help of the crystal ball.
